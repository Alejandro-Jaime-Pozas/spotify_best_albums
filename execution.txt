TODO 

figure out a way to search an artist and album and ultimately retrieve all of that album's tracks in order of track number. 

========================================

ADDING TRACKS TO PLAYLISTS: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/add-tracks-to-playlist 
    uris: string
    A comma-separated list of Spotify URIs to add, can be track or episode URIs. For example:
    uris=spotify:track:4iV5W9uYEdYUVa79Axb7Rh, spotify:track:1301WleyT98MSxVHPZCA6M, spotify:episode:512ojhOuo1ktJprKbVcKyQ
    A maximum of 100 items can be added in one request.
    Note: it is likely that passing a large number of item URIs as a query parameter will exceed the maximum length of the request URI. When adding a large number of items, it is recommended to pass them in the request body, see below.
