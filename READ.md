last run:

- searched the google json api | programmable search engine. looks like this is to create a google search box within your website, doesn't look like this helps in retrieving the actual contents of google search results, will have to use scraper?
- started getting acquainted with chatgpt-generated code in script.py. also with the requests package from python.

Edge cases:

	- Page bottom cut off 	
        - need to click button to get more results (text)
	Multiple pages with results 	
        - need to either click button or change url param
	Slideshow style	 
        - each slideshow has different content (how to change?)
